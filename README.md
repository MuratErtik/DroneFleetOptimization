# DroneFleetOptimization
This project focuses on optimizing the delivery routes of a drone fleet operating under strict constraints such as battery limits and dynamic no-fly zones. Using A* and Genetic Algorithms, the system determines efficient delivery plans while avoiding restricted areas and minimizing energy consumption. The solution is visualized on a 2D map and supports random scenario generation for testing flexibility.
